## what
Stockage is a stock trading game that utilizes historical stock data to allow you to simulate an investment journey spanning the 70s/80s to the current day.

## how
- Flask: connects Python with HTML.
- yfinance: retrieves the historical stock price and description data.
- Chart.js: displays the graph of the stock prices.

## why
I find the concept of simulating investments in the past, especially with the hindsight we have today, to be fascinating. Getting lucky in the early game spotting a $0.05 Walmart or Nike stock is super exciting.
